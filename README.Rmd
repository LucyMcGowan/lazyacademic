# lazyacademic

This package is used to automatically generate files for the Hugo Academic blogdown template by pulling data from a Google Sheet. (This is in very slow development, currently likely just works for me.)

## Installation

You can install lazyacademic from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LucyMcGowan/lazyacademic")
```
